### Want To Play A Game?
While at the carnival, a costumed character approaches you and asks you if you would like to play a game with him.
He tells you that he will give you six 20 dollar bills and he will think of a number between (including) 1 to 100,
which you will need to guess. 

Every time you make a wrong guess, he takes one of the 20 dollar bills from you. If you
make over six failed attempts, then he takes 20 dollars of your own money (he has a credit card machine on him) for each
extra guess.

Is it in your interest to participate?
